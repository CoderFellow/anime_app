Title: Planning of the Anime App.

Core Functionalities:
- uploading downloaded anime
- Playing anime
- hold anime in storage
- anime news


Table: anime
- anime_id
- anime_title
- anime_file_path
- anime_description

========================================================================
This project plan is for a four-week project to create a desktop 
application with the core functionalities of uploading, playing, and 
storing anime, as well as getting anime news. The application, built 
with a Python/Flask backend and an Electron frontend, also includes 
interactive features like glow-up icons, anime sound effects, smooth 
transitions, a live backdrop, and an AI voice-over for plot 
descriptions. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a functional media 
player for local .mp4 files with a server to index them. The project is 
currently in the Core Development phase, with the initial Planning and 
Scoping phase complete, a folder structure and Git repository set up, 
and the foundational technologies of Flask and Electron installed, along 
with the necessary planning documents.
